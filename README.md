# Operating System | notes

## Getting Started

In this website, I'll work on my notes when I have class of [Operating System, Spring 2018](http://newslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/course/OS2018/index.php) by Professor [Tei-Wei Kuo](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~ktw/eng-index.htm)

The materials are mainly from the [Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz-ebook/dp/B00APSZCEQ).

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the notes. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents.

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since there are some LaTeX equations [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) doesn't support, here I use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render the math equations in my website.

I also add [overflow-x: auto](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-x.asp) to prevent the overflow issue on mobile devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.

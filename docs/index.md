# Operating System | notes

In this website, I'll work on my notes when I have class of [Operating System, Spring 2018](http://newslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/course/OS2018/index.php) by Professor [Tei-Wei Kuo](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~ktw/eng-index.htm)

The materials are mainly from the [Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz-ebook/dp/B00APSZCEQ).

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the notes. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents.

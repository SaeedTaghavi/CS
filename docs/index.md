# Computer Science Notes

## Getting Started

In this website, I'll work on my notes about several topics:

- [LeetCode in Python](./LeetCode)
- [Operating System](./OS)
- [Maching Learning](./ML)

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents.

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since there are some LaTeX equations [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) doesn't support, here I use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render the math equations in my website.

I also add [overflow-x: auto](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-x.asp) to prevent the overflow issue on mobile devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.

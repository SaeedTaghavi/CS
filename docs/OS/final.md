1. Terminologies. (24pts)

    - **Deadlock**

        <span style="color:red">A set of process is in a deadlock state when every process in the set is waiting for an event that can be caused by only another process in the set.

    - **Segmentation**

        <span style="color:red">Segmentation is a memory management scheme that supports the user view of memory.

    - **Working Set** (Hint: Thrashing and Frame Allocation)
        
        <span style="color:red">The working set is an approximation of a program's locality.

    - **Optimal Algorithm for Page Replacement (OPT)**
        
        <span style="color:red">Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time.

    - **Hard Link** (Hint: Acyclic-Graph Directory)

        <span style="color:red">A hard link of a file name let its directory entry point to the i-node that describes the file's contents.

    - **Network-Attached Storage (NAS)**

        <span style="color:red">Clients access NAS via a remote procedure call interface such as NFS (for UNIX) or CIFS (for Windows) where NAS has a file system running on it.

    - **Raw Disk**
        
        <span style="color:red">Ans: A partition as a large sequential array of logical blocks.

    2. Please provide one advantage and one disadvantage of a deadlock avoidance algorithm (such as the Banker's Algorithm), compared to a deadlock
   prevention algorithm (such as the one without "Hold-and-Wait"). (6pts)

        - <span style="color:red">Advantage: Better resource utilization and/or better system throughput/performance.
        - <span style="color:red">Dsadvantage: Processes must claim maximum usages of each resource.

Cascading Termination  If a process terminates (either normally or abnormally), then all its children must also be terminated.   exit()  may be called either directly or indirectly ( return ):       exit ( 1 );      /* directly exit with status 1 */    Process Table Entry (PTE)  Contains the process's exit status.    Zombie  A process terminated, but whose parent hasn't called  wait() . Once the parent calls  wait() , the pid of the zombie process and its entry in the PTE are released.   The  init  process periodically invokes  wait()  to collect and release the orphan's pid and PTE.",
